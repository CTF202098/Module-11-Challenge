Module 11 Challenge
Part 1
1.	I used the same imports as Professor Booth did in his example.
2.	I also used his method to create a scraping service on Google Chrome.
3.	I asked Xpert AI how best to create a Beautiful Soup object and it suggested the same method as the one Professor Booth used. I used the method as written by Xpert AI.
4.	I used Prof.’s example to extract all text elements.
5.	I only extracted the title and previews from the articles, per the activity instructions and counter to Prof.’s example.

Part 2
1.	I used the first 4 cells from part 1 to initialize part 2.
2.	I used Prof.’s example to extract all rows of data. 
3.	I also used Prof.’s example as a base to create a list of rows.

This is a first submission, with at least one more submission expected.
